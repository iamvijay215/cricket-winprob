    "\t•\tThe strongest baseline predictor. A team with 80/2 after 10 overs has a very different trajectory from 40/4.\n",
    "\t2.\tOvers left & balls faced\n",
    "\t•\tContext: A team at 80/2 after 10 overs vs 80/2 after 15 overs → very different outcomes.\n",
    "\t•\tRun rate accelerates at different phases (powerplay vs death overs).\n",
    "\t3.\tWickets in hand\n",
    "\t•\tThis changes everything.\n",
    "\t•\t90/1 in 10 overs → can aim for 180–200.\n",
    "\t•\t90/5 in 10 overs → may struggle to reach 150.\n",
    "\t•\tModels learn this “risk appetite” from history.\n",
    "\t4.\tCurrent Run Rate (CRR)\n",
    "\t•\tIndicator of how aggressively a team is scoring right now.\n",
    "\t5.\tRun Rate by Phase\n",
    "\t•\tPowerplay (overs 1–6): high scoring opportunities.\n",
    "\t•\tMiddle overs (7–15): often slower.\n",
    "\t•\tDeath overs (16–20): acceleration.\n",
    "\t•\tCricinfo models learn phase-based expected runs.\n",
    "\t6.\tVenue factor (Ground size, pitch condition)\n",
    "\t•\tWankhede (Mumbai) → high scoring ground.\n",
    "\t•\tChepauk (Chennai) → slower pitch, lower scores.\n",
    "\t•\tHistorical average scores at venue feed into the model.\n",
    "\t7.\tOpposition bowling strength\n",
    "\t•\tIf Bumrah + Rashid Khan are bowling, projections are lower.\n",
    "\t•\tIf part-timers bowl death overs, projections rise.\n",
    "\t•\tCricinfo has detailed player stats → we simplify by encoding bowling team.\n",
    "\t8.\tBatting team strength\n",
    "\t•\tRCB batting with AB de Villiers at the crease is different from a weaker lineup.\n",
    "\t•\tAt minimum, we capture batting team identity.\n",
    "\t9.\tMatch conditions (weather, dew, DLS)\n",

    "\t•\tRatio of CRR vs RRR is crucial:\n",
    "\t•\tCRR > RRR → team likely on track.\n",

    "\t•\tCaptures short-term dynamics.\n",
    "\t7.\tVenue factor (chasing bias)\n",
    "\t•\tSome grounds (e.g., Eden Gardens) are better for chasing because of dew or short boundaries.\n",
    "\t8.\tHistorical chase difficulty\n",
    "\t•\tCricinfo uses historical win percentages for similar chase situations.\n",
