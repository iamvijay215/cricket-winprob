# Cricket Score Prediction & Win Probability (IPL Project)

An **end-to-end Machine Learning + MLOps project** that predicts outcomes in IPL cricket matches.  
The project focuses on two tasks:

1. **First Innings â€“ Score Prediction**  
   - Problem: Given the match state (overs, runs, wickets, batting/bowling team, venue, etc.),  
     predict the **final innings score**.  
   - Type: **Regression** problem.

2. **Second Innings â€“ Win Probability**  
   - Problem: During a chase, given the current state (runs required, balls left, wickets in hand, etc.),  
     predict the **probability (%) that the batting team will win**.  
   - Type: **Classification / Probability Estimation** problem.
